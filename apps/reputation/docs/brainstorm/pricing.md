Sustainability and growth are our models. When apps join the reputation network,
they can provide us with different conveniences that can make it easier for
other apps to integrate with them. Because this promotes growth, by not
providing our application with additional help (being vague here, but let's just
say: data/information that's useful to the network that you aren't required to
disclose or provide) the rates for using our service will be higher.
